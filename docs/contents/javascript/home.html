While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative &#40;e.g. functional programming&#41; styles.</p></article></div><div class="home-div"><article class="home-article"><h1>Organisation</h1><p>For JavaScript I will not focus on doing an extensive reference sheet of the methods or APIs available. Instead the focus will go on a more broad view of the language and the ways you can solve problems and organize code with Design Patterns. The available patterns are on the links on your left, if no links are visible tap or hover on the top left button.</p><p>Most of the info on this page about Design Patterns come from a book by Addy Osmani. I will try to resume the Patterns and show a little code example but you should really check out his book <a class="inline-link quotes" href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/index.html" target="_blank">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns</a> for a more complete reference on the subject.</p></article></div></div>
