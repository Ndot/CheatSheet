<div class="wrapper-content-tmpl"><h2>The Factory Pattern</h2><p>The Factory pattern is another creational pattern concerned with the notion of creating objects. Where it differs from the other patterns in its category is that it doesn't explicitly require us use a constructor. Instead, a Factory can provide a generic interface for creating objects, where we can specify the type of factory object we wish to be created.</p><div><h5>Pattern Example</h5><code class="box code js"><pre>
// A constructor for defining new cars
function Car( options ) {
    this.doors = options.doors || 4;
    this.state = options.state || "brand new";
    this.color = options.color || "silver";
}

// A constructor for defining new trucks
function Truck( options ) {
    this.state = options.state || "used";
    this.wheelSize = options.wheelSize || "large";
    this.color = options.color || "blue";
}


// Factory Example

// Define a skeleton vehicle factory
function VehicleFactory() {}

// Our default vehicleClass is Car
VehicleFactory.prototype.vehicleClass = Car;

// Our Factory method for creating new Vehicle instances
VehicleFactory.prototype.createVehicle = function ( options ) {

    switch(options.vehicleType) {
        case "car":
            this.vehicleClass = Car;
            break;
        case "truck":
            this.vehicleClass = Truck;
            break;
    }

    return new this.vehicleClass( options );
};

// Create an instance of our factory that makes cars
var carFactory = new VehicleFactory();

// Create a new car
var car = carFactory.createVehicle({

    vehicleType: "car",
    color: "yellow",
    doors: 6 
});

// Test to confirm our car was created using the vehicleClass/prototype Car

console.log( car instanceof VehicleFactory );  // Outputs: false
console.log( car instanceof Car );             // Outputs: true

// Outputs: Car object of color "yellow", doors: 6 in a "brand new" state
console.log( car );

Unless providing an interface for object creation is a design goal for the library or framework we are writing, I would suggest sticking to explicit constructors to avoid the unnecessary overhead.</p><p class="little-note">Due to the fact that the process of object creation is effectively abstracted behind an interface, this can also introduce problems with unit testing depending on just how complex this process might be.</p></div></div>
