<div class="wrapper-content-tmpl"><h2>The Facade Pattern</h2><p></p><p>Like the name sugests the Facade Pattern is way of presenting a more simplified interface of a more complex code. This pattern provides a convenient higher-level interface to a larger body of code. Think of it as simplifying the API being presented to other developers, something which almost always improves usability.</p><p>Facades are a structural pattern which can often be seen in JavaScript libraries like jQuery where, although an implementation may support methods with a wide range of behaviors, only a "facade" or limited abstraction of these methods is presented to the public for use. For exemple in the jQuery library, most of us are aware that both getElementById("identifier") and $("#identifier") can be used to query an element on a page by its ID.</p><p></p><div><h5>Pattern Example</h5><code class="box code js"><pre>
var module = (function () {

    var _private = {
    
        i: 5,
        mode: 'run',
        get: function () {
            console.log("current value: " + this.i);
        },
        set: function (val) {
            this.i = val;
        },
        run: function () {
            console.log("running");
        },
        jump: function () {
            console.log("jumping");
        }
    };

    return {

        facade: function (args = {}) {
            if (args.val) { _private.set(args.val); }
            _private.get();

            if (args.state) { _private.mode = args.state; }
            _private[_private.mode]();
        }
    };
}());

module.facade();
// current value: 5
// running

module.facade({ val: 34, state: 'jump' });
// current value: 34
// jumping
</pre></code></div><div class="disadvantages conclusion"><h5>Disadvantages</h5><p class="little-note">Facades generally have few disadvantages, but one concern worth noting is performance. Namely, one must determine whether there is an implicit cost to the abstraction a Facade offers to our implementation and if so, whether this cost is justifiable.</p></div></div>
