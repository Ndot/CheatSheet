<div class="wrapper-content-tmpl"><h2>The Flyweight Pattern</h2><div></div><div><p>The Flyweight Pattern is used to reduce the amount of data created by sharing as much as possible between objects. This aims to minimize memory usaged in an application.</p><p>The way this works is by creating an object with as much identical data as possible and placing it in an external object. Other object can than share this data without having to create it, avoiding having identical data across multiple objects.</p><p>There are two concepts we need to understand to make the Flyweight Pattern work, these are intrinsic and extrinsic data.</p><span class="little-note">Intrinsic - This is information is what we want our object to share.</span><br><span class="little-note">Extrinsic - This is information that can be removed and it might not be the same to all objects.</span></div><div></div><div><p>For this example we want to manage lights in our house. For that we need some sort light class that's able to create light and place them in the correct rooms.</p><p>First thing to do is to create a simple Light Class that creates lights.</p></div><div><code class="box code js"><pre>// Light Class
function Light(shape, power) {
    this.shape = shape;
    this.power = power;
}

Light.prototype = { color: 'white', }
</pre></code></div><div><p>Now we want to make sure we don't create more lights that we need to. For this we can create a Light Factory Singleton.</p></div><div><code class="box code js"><pre>
// Light Factory Singleton
var LightFactory = (function () {
    var lights = {},
        light,
        lightCount = 0;

    return {
        getLight: function (shape, power) {

            // Find if this particular light was already created.
            light = lights[shape + power];
            if (light) {
                return light;

It doesn't know if is a new light our an exintent one, it just know it gets a light object to work with. On top of that we keep a reference to our rooms and we just push our light into the <span class="highlight-text">rooms[room].lights</span> array.</p></div><div><h5>Test LightManager</h5><code class="box code js"><pre>// Let's add some lights...
