# CheatSheet
[Cheat Sheet Page](https://ndot.github.io/CheatSheet)

### Purpose

Some months ago (April 2016) I started my first contact with programming. Mainly `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.
This page was born from the necessity to create something and apply what I've been studying.
This page is just a reference sheet for me and of course anyone who wants to use it :smile: .
